# 3 card poker

As we all know- if you need money quick, you get yourself a payday loan and then head to the nearest
black jack table or jack vegas machine. If you're not in need of money though, you could always level up your iq points by
practising 3 card poker in a console application. Even though mathematicly there's only one way to play the game for the best possible outcome.
I.e. play all hands with Queen high with a +7 kicker (45% win rate), you just might learn something. Hopefully you dont!
